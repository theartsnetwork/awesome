        This Artmarq Subscription Agreement (the Agreement) includes the terms and definitions set out below.
        This Agreement is not effective until accepted by Akshay Jirage and his sole proprietary firm E&E International
        registered in India. Akshay Jirage on behalf of E&E International, is the owner of technology which aggregates
        data across multiple sources and creates a data file (the Data Service) which Artmarq makes available to its customers
        (each a Subscriber) for such Subscriber’s internal business purposes. Subscriber and Artmarq are herein referred to
        individually as a Party and collectively as the Parties.
        Access to Artmarq is subject to Subscriber’s payment of the subscription fee for the Data Service and subscription
        terms as provided by Artmarq and selected by Subscriber when subscribing on Artmarq’s website (the Subscription).
        The Subscription, incorporated in this Agreement, is subject to change and all subscription fees are non-cancelable and non-refundable,
        except as otherwise expressly set forth herein.</p>
    <div class="spacer" style="height: 30px;"></div>
    <h3>LICENSE GRANTS</h3>
      <p class="smaller">Data Service</br>
        Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Artmarq hereby grants to Subscriber a limited, nonexclusive, royalty-free, non-transferable
        right to a one (1) user seat license to use the Data Service solely for its internal business purposes. Subscriber shall not (i) provide access to
        the Data Service to unauthorized third parties, (ii) publicly publish, copy (except for internal use), duplicate or replicate the Data Service,
        (iii) scrape any data, content or intellectual property, or otherwise trespass or interfere with Artmarq’s Data Service or systems; or (iv) sublicense,
        distribute or transfer the Data Service or underlying data except as otherwise expressly permitted herein.</p>
    <div class="spacer" style="height: 30px;"></div>
    <h3>Availability of the Data Service</h3>
      <p class="smaller">Artmarq shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide the Data Service to Subscribers at the regular intervals as set forth in the Subscription.
        However, there will be occasions when the Data Service will be interrupted for maintenance, upgrades and repairs, or as a result of failure of
        telecommunications links and equipment that are beyond Artmarq’s control. Artmarq shall take reasonable steps to minimize such disruption,
        to the extent it is within Artmarq’s reasonable control. Under no circumstances shall Artmarq be liable to Subscriber for any interruptions,
        outages, or other system failures that are beyond Artmarq’s control.</br>
        Subscriber acknowledges and agrees that Artmarq obtains the data for the Data Service from third parties, and that such sources may become
        temporarily or permanently unavailable. If such unavailability materially affects Artmarq’s ability to provide the Data Service in whole or in part
        for more than thirty consecutive days, Subscriber shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement upon written notice to Artmarq and receive a pro rata
        refund of the last subscription fee paid.</p>
        <div class="spacer" style="height: 30px;"></div>

        <h3>Fees.</h3>
        <p class="smaller">In consideration for the license granted by Artmarq, Subscriber agrees to pay to Artmarq the subscription fee selected by Subscriber on Artmarq’s
          website or separate written order form, as applicable, in accordance with the Subscription.</p>
          <div class="spacer" style="height: 30px;"></div>
        <h3>Payment Terms.</h3>
        <p class="smaller">The payments to Artmarq shall be made as set forth in the Subscription. Subscriber shall be responsible for and pay all sales tax, use taxes or other
          taxes or charges of any kind imposed by any federal, state or local government entity for any financial transactions arising out of this Agreement.
          All undisputed overdue amounts shall bear interest at the rate of 10% per annum or the maximum legal rate, if less. Artmarq shall be entitled to its cost of collection,
          including reasonable attorney’s fees in connection with its attempts to collect any amounts owed under this Agreement.</p>
        <div class="spacer" style="height: 30px;"></div>
        <h3>CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION</h3>
          <p class="smaller"> Definition. Confidential Information shall mean and include all of the confidential and proprietary information and all other information, not in the public domain,
            that relates to the Data Service. All information disclosed or revealed by a Party hereunder orally, electronically, in writing or in any other tangible form, shall
            be deemed to be Confidential Information if (i) it has been marked confidential; (ii) the other Party has been placed on notice, orally or in writing, of its confidential
            nature; or (iii) due to its character or nature, a reasonable person under similar circumstances would treat such information as confidential.

          and use with the same degree of care that such receiving Party uses to protect its own non-public and confidential information, but in no event less than a commercially
          reasonable degree of care. The receiving Party will not use the disclosing Party’s Confidential Information for purposes other than those necessary to directly further
          the purposes of this Agreement. The receiving Party will not disclose to third parties the disclosing Party’s Confidential Information without prior written consent
          of the disclosing Party.
        </br>Non-Confidential Information. Information shall not be considered Confidential Information to the extent, but only to the extent, that the receiving Party can document
        that such information (i) is or becomes generally known or available to the public through no fault of the receiving Party, (ii) was in the receiving Party’s possession before
        receipt from the disclosing Party under this Agreement or any prior agreement or understanding between or among the Parties, or (iii) is lawfully obtained from a third party who
        has the right to make such disclosure.
        </br>Disclosure of Confidential Information. These provisions shall not prevent the receiving Party from disclosing Confidential Information where it is required to do so by
        law or by a binding court order save that, to the extent legally permissible, it shall notify the disclosing Party of such disclosure and allow the disclosing Party
        a reasonable opportunity to object to such disclosure.</p>
