 		    <h3>Q. I am a seasoned art professional and quite familiar with art business,
 		      do I need Artmarq App on my iPhone?</h3>
 		    <p class="smaller">A. We created Artmarq App with people like you in mind to deliver the data-driven decision making
 		       in a very user friendly way through an app which is consistent in its design across platforms and devices.</br>
 		       Artmarq App is must have on your iPhone because its so easy and intuitive that you would love the data and analytics again.</p>
 		       <div class="spacer" style="height: 30px;"></div>

 		    <h3>Q. How Artmarq is different from other art market database sites like Artnet or Artprice?</h3>
 		    <p class="smaller">A. First of all, Artmarq App is Free (while in Beta) and it is mobile first technology startup focused on Art Business.
 		      You get deal information on the go and when it comes to price for the information
 		      they provide on desktop vs. price for Artmarq information on your iPhones, you know the difference.</p>
 		      <div class="spacer" style="height: 30px;"></div>

 		    <h3>Q. Why is Artmarq Free while in beta? Are there any plans to charge users later when Artmarq App goes mainstream?</h3>
 		    <p class="smaller">A. Since the development of the entire project funded by Akshay Jirage himself and it is too early to make any comment on final business model,
 		      the beta version will be offered for free to registered users and no credit card information is needed.</br>
 		      However we can not guarantee that the business model remains the same given various deals we are working on in the meantime
 		      to deliver the best possible data-driven content.</p>
 		      <div class="spacer" style="height: 30px;"></div>

 		    <h3>Q. What happens to the Artmarq App that I have downloaded on my iPhone device when Artmarq is decided on pricing?</h3>
 		    <p class="smaller">A. The basic version (including current version) of the Artmarq App will continue to work on your iPhone with limited features
 		      and for more advanced feature users will have to update.</br>
 		      New pricing, if any will be released through a new version or update of the Artmarq App on Apple App Store. In near future,
 		      we will try to make the process of moving to paid tier as simple as clicking a button.</p>

 		    <h3>Q. It’s Art business, Art Market Data & Analytics (which means gibberish for me) and I am an Artist or Student or a professional less interested in market aspect of art,
